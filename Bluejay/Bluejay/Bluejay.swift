/**
 Bluejay is a simple wrapper around CoreBluetooth that focuses on making a common usage case as straight forward as possible: a single connected peripheral that the user is interacting with regularly (think most personal electronics devices that have an associated iOS app: fitness trackers, guitar amps, etc).
 
 It also supports a few other niceties for simplifying usage, including automatic discovery of services and characteristics as they are used, as well as supporting a background task mode where the interaction with the device can be written as synchronous calls running on a background thread to avoid callback pyramids of death, or heavily chained promises.
