/**
    A protocol allowing conforming objects registered to Bluejay to optionally respond to Bluetooth connection events.
 
    - Attention
    On initial subscription to Bluetooth events, `bluetoothAvailable(_ available: Bool)` will always be called immediately with whatever the current state is, and `connected(to peripheral: Peripheral)` will also be called immediately if a device is already connected.

    - Note
    Available callbacks:
    * `func bluetoothAvailable(_ available: Bool)`
    * `func connected(to peripheral: Peripheral)`
    * `func disconnected(from peripheral: Peripheral)`
